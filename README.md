The Rust Playground website is great for playing around with a small
idea in Rust, but it's unfortunate that it has to run in the browser
on someone elses machine, subject to rate limiting, slow compile times, 8 second timeouts...

How about instead of using it in the browser, you could use it in your regular editor!

## Example

Use the command to create a new rust playground. Adjust the newly created terminals to your liking. Save the open file and watch it output in the terminal
